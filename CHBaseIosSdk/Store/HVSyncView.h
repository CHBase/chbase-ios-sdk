//
// SyncViews implement a simple model for maintaing read-only OFFLINE/Local Storage
// views and caches of the items in a HealthVault record.
//
// SyncViews automatically download and store copies of HealthVault items (HVItems) in
// your LocalVault as needed.
// Like Database views, each SyncView has an associated Query (HVItemQuery)
//
// SyncView implement read-only synchronization, downloading changed items when required.
// SyncView use a simple synchronization and caching model--similar to that used by
// HTML & RSS.
//
// The Query for a view defines the set of HVItems in the view.
// Each SyncView maintains a COLLECTION (array) of the KEYS (HVItemKey) for the items in
// the view.
//     - The view fetches ONLY the updated set of ItemKeys when it is REFRESHED (synchronized).
//     - The view does not fetch the *actual* item data until necessary.
//     - Keys are relatively small in size
//     - The collection of item keys representing the view can optionally be saved and
//      loaded from the LocalVault.
//
//     - When the caller asks for the HVItem for a particular ItemKey, the view checks
//      the LocalVault for a copy that was downloaded earlier - EITHER by this view or another.
//          - BOTH the itemID and the version stamp must match.
//          - If a local copy is available (the itemID & the version matched), it returns
//          the item immediately.
//          (All Views share the same underlying LocalVault. An item that appears in multiple
//          views and was downloaded via one...is automatically available for the others).
//          - If a local item is not available, the view downloads the item from HealthVault
//          in the background and lets you know when the item is available.
//          - The view may chose to *read ahead* and download additional items in anticipation
//          of future usage.
//
//     - Like an HTML page or RSS feed, the application chooses to periodically REFRESH the SyncView
//          - The application decides that a SyncView is *stale*- i.e. not refreshed for some
//          time interval, such as 1 day.
//          OR the user hits a refresh button.
//          - This refreshed set of keys can be saved to the LocalVault and subsequently loaded
//          from the local store, just like a cached HTML page or RSS feed.
//          - For any given View, virtually ALL the ItemKeys will be unchanged from refresh to refresh.
//          - If a matching HVItem was downloaded by any of your views,
//          - Thus, once downloaded, an HVItem will only ever need to downloaded again if:
//              - The item was updated (version stamp is different)
//              - The item was deleted from the local store
//          - This minimizes the amount of data that must be periodically synchronized.
//
// Classes that adopt the HVSyncView protocol use different mechanisms to notify
// the application of changes to the view.
